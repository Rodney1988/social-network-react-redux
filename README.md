# social-network-react-redux
My own social network project used for learning React, Redux, Node.js, PostgreSQL and Socket.IO. The application is not working anymore as it was built in 2018 and was not maintained.

However, you can view the source code while it was working if you please. The application allowed adding and removing friends, logging in to your own profile, posting wall messages and pictures, and chatting privately live with other friends (thanks to websockets.io)
